Waste Classifier 🗑️♻️

Overview

The Waste Classifier is a deep learning-based model that classifies waste materials into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories. By leveraging CNNs and multi-head attention mechanisms, the model improves classification accuracy and can be integrated into real-time applications for waste management.

Features

✅ Deep Learning-Based Classification – Uses CNNs and attention mechanisms for better feature extraction.
✅ Real-Time Classification – Deployable on mobile or web apps for instant waste categorization.
✅ Transfer Learning – Optimized using pre-trained models for improved performance.
✅ Sustainable Impact – Aims to promote effective waste disposal and recycling.
